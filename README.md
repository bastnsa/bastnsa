### Hello there!

I'm a self-taught programmer exploring back-end development. My journey into programming began when I first encountered Python; since then, I've been obsessed with writing programs and understanding the intricate details that form large processes.

I work on developing custom tools and automating tasks in Revit. My current focus is crafting add-ins and pyRevit extensions for specific workflows.
